# Concrete-Strength-Prediction-using-Keras
his repository contains Jupyter notebooks (Parts A, B, C, D) for predicting concrete strength using Keras. It demonstrates model optimization through changes in epochs, normalization, and hidden layers. The project shows progressive improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.
